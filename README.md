- 👋 Hi, I’m @JusDaTipIn1
- 👀 I’m interested in learning after having my identity stolen in the spherion breach and the T-Mobile breach, I decided to try and do the right thing
So I'm currently a student attending for my bachelor's in information technology cybersecurities. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cyber security using coding. I ended up pretty much teaching myself. What I do know it's extremely limited. I am open to learning on
So if you have any insight or words of wisdom I would greatly appreciate it. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding and cybersecurities.
